# ViraX: Viral Marketing using Influence Maximization (IM)

About:
A project on influence maximization using greedy, page rank and degree centrality algorithms and showing real time graph influence simulation with line chart, bar chart, pie chart and heat map.

Outcomes:
● Analyzed network data to model influence propagation using Python libraries like NetworkX,
NumPy, and Pandas.
● Developed and implemented an Independent Cascade Model (ICM) to simulate the spread of
influence in the network.
● Engineered a greedy algorithm for optimal seed node selection, maximizing influence within a
specified budget.
● Conducted parameter tuning and sensitivity analysis to optimize algorithm performance and
robustness.
● Communicated results and provided actionable insights for viral marketing campaigns based on
influence maximization findings.
