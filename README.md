# ViraX: Viral Marketing using Influence Maximization (IM)

## About
ViraX is a project focused on leveraging influence maximization techniques to enhance viral marketing campaigns. The project includes the implementation of various algorithms such as greedy, PageRank, and degree centrality to identify key nodes for maximizing message propagation within a network. The project also features real-time graph influence simulation with animation, line chart, bar chart, pie chart, and heat map visualizations.

## Outcomes
- Analyzed network data using Python libraries like NetworkX, NumPy, and Pandas to model influence propagation.
- Developed and implemented an Independent Cascade Model (ICM) to simulate the spread of influence in the network.
- Engineered a greedy algorithm for optimal seed node selection, maximizing influence within a specified budget.
- Conducted parameter tuning and sensitivity analysis to optimize algorithm performance and robustness.
- Communicated results and provided actionable insights for viral marketing campaigns based on influence maximization findings.

## Installation
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/shubhaygautam/ViraX-Influence-Maximization.git`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- Run the main script to execute the influence maximization algorithms and visualize the results.
